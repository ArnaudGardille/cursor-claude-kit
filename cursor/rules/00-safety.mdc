# Safety (always on)

## Non-negotiables
- Never execute destructive operations against **production** data/systems.
- Never drop/delete/truncate collections/tables/indexes by default.
- Never run broad cleanup scripts without an explicit target and rollback plan.

## If a destructive change is explicitly required
You must provide:
1) Exact operations to run (commands/queries).
2) Migration strategy (including staging validation).
3) Rollback strategy.
4) A clear checkpoint that asks for explicit confirmation before applying anything destructive.

## Destructive code must be written commented-out
When writing code that contains destructive operations (drop, delete, truncate, insert_many, update_many, remove, destroy, purge, overwrite, seed, wipe, or any bulk mutation), **always write those lines commented-out** with a `# REVIEW:` (or `// REVIEW:` in TS/JS) marker explaining what the line does.
